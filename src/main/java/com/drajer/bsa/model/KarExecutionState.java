/**
 *
 *
 * <h1>KarExecutionState</h1>
 *
 * The Entity represents the execution context that can be saved for processing across timers and
 * jobs. In other words as data is collected by executing a series of actions and jobs are scheduled
 * to execute events at a later time, there is no need to re-create all the data that future actions
 * in the same workflow require. For example, if the check-trigger-codes action finds a match but
 * the create-report action has to be executed after a period of 1 hour, then a timer will be set
 * for 1 hour. When the timer expires instead of recomputing the check-trigger-codes result, it is
 * optimal to store the result temporarily until the workflow completes and then reuse the data.
 * This will reduce the burden on the EHRs and also will enable the cleanup of state after the
 * workflow is completed.
 *
 * <p>The KarExecutionState contains all the information to recreate the KarProcessingData which is
 * the transient version and is used across actions for computation. The reason for splitting the
 * two is to ensure that minmimum data is stored in the db temporarily to establish state and not
 * dump everything that is represented in different formats for processing purposes.
